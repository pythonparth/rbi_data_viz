### ðŸ§  Inference in context of your hypothesis
- Policy stance shifted â€” whether by design or under influence, the RBI allowed currency in circulation to grow faster in absolute terms than in the earlier era.
- Liquidity preference stayed high â€” people continued to hold cash at similar proportions to total money supply, suggesting no structural move toward a cashâ€‘light economy.
- Potential FX impact â€” if this faster cash expansion wasnâ€™t matched by productivity gains or forex inflows, it could contribute to inflationary pressure and weaken the rupee.
